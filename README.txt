The bath university app, when opened, consists of five main areas separated by tabs 
at the top of the project. These tabs are: Settings, Bus Times, Lectures, Tasks and Maps.

1. Settings

The settings tab allows the user to input each of their name, username, favourite bus, 
course and year. 

2. Buses
The first buses tab allows the you to select the bus they would like to check the 
times for, if it is different to their default bus. 

From there, you can select the timetable type (e.g. weekend, holidayâ€¦), and current bus stop.

Not all bus timetables are currently included. Both the 18 and U18 for weekdays and
weekends are included, and the X18 for weekdays, for demonstration. 

3. Lectures
The lectures tab imports from the calendar file for the selected course and year.
Currently, only the following are included for demonstration:

completed tasks
